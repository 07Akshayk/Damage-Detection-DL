# Detecting Damaged Components of Rockets Using Deep Learning Model

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for detecting damaged components of rockets. The model will analyze images of the rocket's components and determine whether they are damaged or not. The goal is to improve the safety and reliability of rockets by quickly identifying any potential issues.
## Team Members:

- Amal Thomas
- Akshay K
- Abhiram Krishnan
- Albin Daniel

## Methodology:

The deep learning model will be developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNNs will be trained on a dataset of images of undamaged and damaged rocket components. Once trained, the model will be able to analyze new images and accurately classify the components as damaged or undamaged.


## Tools:

The deep learning model will be developed using Python and popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. The project will also require tools for image preprocessing and data augmentation.

## Expected Outcome:

The expected outcome of this project is a deep learning model that can accurately detect damaged components of rockets. This model can be used by rocket manufacturers and space agencies to improve the safety and reliability of rockets.
